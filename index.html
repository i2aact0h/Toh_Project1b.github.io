					To all my friends, thank you for sticking by me through thick and thin. We all had our differences and our struggles, but it was all worth it in the end.<br>
          There are many times that I just sit and think about how much I miss you all. It has been so long and, though I have new friends, I would still like to remember the good old days.

						I remember the times when we used to laugh and play. I also remember the times when we would complain, encourage one another, and berate one another during school.<br>
            There were times that I wish we could go back. Relive good times and change bad times. Nevertheless, your faith in my abilities and my faith in yours made us resilient people.

              We were taught and we taught each other. How to skip class, copy assignments, compare grades, and many other things. I am thankful for the times we all<br>
              got in trouble together. Guys, we are all stronger and more empathetic towards our fellow man because of all the stupid stuff we all did before. These things<br>
              taught us restraint, annalysis, and discipline.

						It is beacuse of your fun-loving, cold, insulting, and many other complex personalities that I made and identity for myself. It was thanks to all of you guys that I was<br>
            able to survive school and figure out what and who I want to be in the future.
